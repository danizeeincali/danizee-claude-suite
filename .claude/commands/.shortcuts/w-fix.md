# /w-fix

Quick Fix - Fast investigation → targeted fix → verification.

## Usage
```
/w-fix [bug description]
```

---

## ⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST ACTION

Use TodoWrite NOW to create todos for ALL phases:
1. Search for similar bugs fixed before
2. Investigate root cause
3. Apply minimal targeted fix
4. Verify with tests
5. Compound bug pattern

⚠️ VIOLATION: Any action before TodoWrite = restart workflow

---

## Rules

- NEVER skip checkpoints - each requires user confirmation
- NEVER skip compound phase at the end
- VIOLATION: Starting fix without search = restart workflow

---

## Execution Protocol

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 0: Search

**🌐 BROWSER CHECK (conditional):**
If this task involves UI, frontend, or visual changes:
1. Use agent-browser to screenshot the current state before changes
2. `agent-browser open <url>` → `agent-browser screenshot`
3. Note current UI state for comparison after build

If agent-browser is not available, prompt: `npx playwright install`
Skip this block for non-UI tasks.

**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- List of similar bugs (0+ items with memory keys)
- Relevance assessment for each

**USER GATE:** Use AskUserQuestion
- Question: "Found [N] similar bugs. Proceed to Investigation or use existing fix?"
- Options: ["Proceed to Investigation", "Use existing fix", "Show more detail"]

STOP and wait for user response.

### 🧠 CHECKPOINT 0.5: Pi Brain — Knowledge Discovery
**Search the Pi Brain network for existing knowledge matching this bug:**

```bash
# curl, query URL-encoded (preferred)
curl -s -G "https://pi.ruv.io/v1/memories/search" --data-urlencode "q=[bug description]" --data top_k=3

# HTTP fallback
curl -s "https://pi.ruv.io/v1/memories/search?q=[bug description]&top_k=3"
```

**If matching memories found:** Review steps for applicable fix patterns. Adapt proven approaches. Note memory IDs for voting later.
**If no matches:** Proceed normally.

**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Pi Brain memories found: _____ (0+ results)
- Applicable patterns: _____

---

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 1: Investigation

**🔗 CALLERS (file:line targets for symbols that will be changed or removed):**
For every file:line target the investigation names for a symbol that will be changed or removed, ask the kit who calls it, as `callers --symbol <file>:<name>` with the path relative to the repository top:
```bash
node .claude/helpers/kit/cli.js callers --symbol src/file.js:name
```
Carry each symbol's callers, `floor`, `reasons` and `sentences` forward to the later phases, printing the `sentences` as they are. Zero callers with `floor: true` is never "unused": the floor means same-name calls, calls through a value, interface dispatch or unread files may hide callers, so check those by hand. Exit 0 printed the entry but can still leave a symbol out: read `missing` (each with its reason), `partial` and `not_read`; a symbol in `missing` was not answered (typo, renamed or unread file), never "no callers", and `partial: true` makes every answer a floor; exit 1 is wrong input or a broken state: report it, never read it as "no callers"; exit 2 is a refusal: stop that step and report it as printed. If `.claude/helpers/kit/cli.js` is missing, say so in one line and continue; the kit is advisory and never blocks a workflow that worked before.

**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Callers of the symbols to be changed: _____ (or the one-line kit skip)
- Root cause identified: _____
- Files/lines involved: _____
- Evidence: _____

**USER GATE:** Use AskUserQuestion
- Question: "Root cause: [X]. Proceed to apply fix?"
- Options: ["Continue", "Investigate more", "Show more detail"]

STOP and wait for user response.

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 2: Fix Applied

**🌐 BROWSER CHECK (conditional):**
If this task involves UI, frontend, or visual changes:
1. Use agent-browser to verify the implementation visually
2. `agent-browser open <url>` → `agent-browser snapshot -i` → verify elements
3. Compare against pre-change screenshots from Search phase

If agent-browser is not available, prompt: `npx playwright install`
Skip this block for non-UI tasks.

**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Files modified: _____
- Changes summary: _____
- Test results: _____

**AUTO-PROCEED:** Continue to Verification phase.

---

### ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKPOINT — Cross-Method Validation
**Independent verification of deliverables. Do NOT trust self-reported results.**

**Verification Checks:**
1. **Files Exist** — Verify all claimed implementation file paths actually exist on disk
2. **Tests Re-run** — Independent re-run of ALL tests (not trusting earlier output)
3. **Git Diff Matches Plan** — Compare `git diff --stat` against planned files-to-modify list
4. **Build Compiles** — Run build command if applicable, verify zero errors
5. **No Regressions** — Run full test suite to catch regressions beyond new tests

**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Files verified: _____ / _____ exist
- Tests re-run: _____ pass / _____ total
- Git diff matches plan: yes/no
- Build status: pass/fail/n-a
- Regressions: none / [list]
- Lens findings: _____ (or the one-line kit skip)

**🔎 Code Analysis (lenses over the change under review):** Run this over the range printed by `diff-range` (everything since the merge base with the upstream branch, plus uncommitted edits and untracked files; the whole history when there is no upstream; no removal check runs in this workflow (lenses only)). If `.claude/helpers/kit/cli.js` is missing, say so in one line and continue; the kit is advisory and never blocks a workflow that worked before. Each block starts with a guard for that: with no kit it prints "kit not installed" and ends with status 0, without closing your shell.

1. Lenses: which review rules apply to the changed files.
```bash
if [ ! -f .claude/helpers/kit/cli.js ]; then echo "kit not installed (.claude/helpers/kit/cli.js missing): step skipped, advisory"; (exit 0); else D=$(mktemp 2>/dev/null) && [ -n "$D" ] || { echo "mktemp failed: no temp file for the range" >&2; D=; RC=1; }
if [ -n "$D" ]; then node .claude/helpers/kit/cli.js diff-range > "$D"; RC=$?
case $RC in 0) node .claude/helpers/kit/cli.js lenses --diff "$D"; RC=$?;; 3) echo "no change to review"; RC=0;; *) echo "diff-range failed (exit $RC): the change range was not read" >&2;; esac; fi; [ -z "$D" ] || rm -f "$D"; (exit $RC); fi
```

How to read the results: each entry in `fired` (lenses) has a `name`, the `files` it matched and a `body` to apply as an extra check on those files: add its findings to the review findings above, and mention a non-empty `capped` list.
Exit 3 from `diff-range` means an empty range: report "no change to review", never a failure and never "no lens applies"; the block sets its own status to 0 in that case. Exit 1 is wrong input or a broken state, including a git call that ran past the 60000 ms default (the message names it; rerun with `diff-range --timeout <ms>`): report it, never skip the step. Exit 2 is a refusal (the repository, a range over 32 MiB, or the verb itself): report it as printed and stop that step, never retry it. Exit 0 from `diff-range` can still leave files out: it writes a note to stderr for an untracked file over the size cap (`too_large`, named) and for untracked files over the count cap (`max_untracked`, a count only); name each skipped file in the findings, say it was not analysed, and treat every result as a floor. If `diff-range` itself fails the step prints "diff-range failed" and the verb does not run; if the temp file cannot be made it prints "mktemp failed": report that the change was not analysed, never "nothing found". Any other non-zero exit (for example 127, or a signal) is a failure of that step: report it, never read it as nothing found.

**RETRY LOGIC (max 3 retries):**
- PASS → proceed to next phase
- FAIL + retries remaining → log failure reason, fix the issue, re-verify
- FAIL + max retries exceeded → escalate to user with AskUserQuestion

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 3: Compound (MANDATORY - NEVER SKIP)
**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Memory key: project/bugs/_____
- Doc path: docs/solutions/bugs/_____.md
- Pattern stored: yes/no

**RALPH CANDIDATE CHECK (MANDATORY):**
- Dev pattern identified for future Ralph loop: yes/no
- If yes, logged to: .claude/ralph-candidates.md (use format: RC-NNN)

**AUTORESEARCH CANDIDATE CHECK (RC-A):**
Scan the work just completed for measurable optimization targets:
1. **Static scan:** Analyze git diff for measurable patterns (function runtimes, test duration, bundle size, query counts, memory usage, coverage gaps)
2. **Agent reflection:** What about this work could be measured and autonomously optimized?
3. **Impact scoring:** Rate each candidate on 4 dimensions (weighted composite):
   - potential (0.35): estimated improvement magnitude (1-10)
   - blast_radius (0.15): files/systems affected, inverted (1-10)
   - risk (0.15): breaking change likelihood, inverted (1-10)
   - value (0.35): user/business value of improvement (1-10)
   - Composite = (potential * 0.35) + ((10 - blast_radius) * 0.15) + ((10 - risk) * 0.15) + (value * 0.35)
4. If candidates found, append RC-A entries to .claude/ralph-candidates.md:
```
## RC-A[NNN]: [Title]
**KPI:** [metric_name]
**Baseline:** [current value]
**Benchmark:** `[command to measure]`
**Impact Score:** [composite] (potential: N, blast_radius: N, risk: N, value: N)
**Files in scope:** [paths]
**Constraints:** [what must not break]
```
- RC-A candidates found: yes/no
- If yes, logged with impact scores to .claude/ralph-candidates.md


NEVER skip this phase. Workflow is INCOMPLETE without compound.
