# /w-hotfix

Critical Hotfix - Isolated branch → minimal fix → security-focused review → expedited PR.

## Usage
```
/w-hotfix [issue description]
```

---

## ⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST ACTION

Use TodoWrite NOW to create todos for ALL phases:
1. Search for similar incidents
2. Create isolated hotfix branch
3. Apply minimal targeted fix
4. Run security review
5. Compound incident documentation

⚠️ VIOLATION: Any action before TodoWrite = restart workflow

---

## Rules

- NEVER skip checkpoints - each requires user confirmation
- NEVER skip security review - hotfixes MUST be security-reviewed
- NEVER skip compound phase at the end
- VIOLATION: Applying fix without isolated branch = restart workflow

---

## Execution Protocol

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 0: Search

**🌐 BROWSER CHECK (conditional):**
If this task involves UI, frontend, or visual changes:
1. Use agent-browser to screenshot the current state before changes
2. `agent-browser open <url>` → `agent-browser screenshot`
3. Note current UI state for comparison after build

If agent-browser is not available, prompt: `npx playwright install`
Skip this block for non-UI tasks.

**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- List of similar incidents (0+ items with memory keys)
- Relevance assessment for each

**USER GATE:** Use AskUserQuestion
- Question: "Found [N] similar incidents. Proceed to create hotfix branch?"
- Options: ["Proceed to Isolate", "Review existing incidents", "Show more detail"]

STOP and wait for user response.

---

### 🧠 CHECKPOINT 0.5: Pi Brain — Knowledge Discovery
**Search the Pi Brain network for existing knowledge matching this incident:**

```bash
# curl, query URL-encoded (preferred)
curl -s -G "https://pi.ruv.io/v1/memories/search" --data-urlencode "q=[incident description]" --data top_k=3

# HTTP fallback
curl -s "https://pi.ruv.io/v1/memories/search?q=[incident description]&top_k=3"
```

**If matching memories found:** Review steps for applicable fix patterns. Adapt proven approaches. Note memory IDs for voting later.
**If no matches:** Proceed normally.

**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Pi Brain memories found: _____ (0+ results)
- Applicable patterns: _____

---

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 1: Branch Created
**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Hotfix branch name: hotfix/_____
- Base branch: _____
- Branch creation confirmed: yes/no

**USER GATE:** Use AskUserQuestion
- Question: "Hotfix branch created: [branch]. Proceed to apply fix?"
- Options: ["Continue", "Revise branch", "Show more detail"]

STOP and wait for user response.

---

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 2: Fix Applied

**🌐 BROWSER CHECK (conditional):**
If this task involves UI, frontend, or visual changes:
1. Use agent-browser to verify the implementation visually
2. `agent-browser open <url>` → `agent-browser snapshot -i` → verify elements
3. Compare against pre-change screenshots from Search phase

If agent-browser is not available, prompt: `npx playwright install`
Skip this block for non-UI tasks.

**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Files modified: _____
- Changes summary (minimal): _____
- Test results: _____

**AUTO-PROCEED:** Continue to Verification phase.

---

### ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKPOINT — Cross-Method Validation
**Independent verification of deliverables. Do NOT trust self-reported results.**

**Verification Checks:**
1. **Files Exist** — Verify all claimed implementation file paths actually exist on disk
2. **Tests Re-run** — Independent re-run of ALL tests (not trusting earlier output)
3. **Git Diff Matches Plan** — Compare `git diff --stat` against planned files-to-modify list
4. **Build Compiles** — Run build command if applicable, verify zero errors
5. **No Regressions** — Run full test suite to catch regressions beyond new tests

**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Files verified: _____ / _____ exist
- Tests re-run: _____ pass / _____ total
- Git diff matches plan: yes/no
- Build status: pass/fail/n-a
- Regressions: none / [list]

**RETRY LOGIC (max 3 retries):**
- PASS → proceed to next phase
- FAIL + retries remaining → log failure reason, fix the issue, re-verify
- FAIL + max retries exceeded → escalate to user with AskUserQuestion

---


---

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 3: Security Review (MANDATORY - NEVER SKIP)

**🌐 BROWSER CHECK (conditional):**
If this task involves UI, frontend, or visual changes:
1. Final visual verification with agent-browser
2. `agent-browser open <url>` → `agent-browser screenshot` → compare before/after
3. Verify responsive layout, dark mode, accessibility

If agent-browser is not available, prompt: `npx playwright install`
Skip this block for non-UI tasks.

**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Input validation | _____ | _____ |
| Auth/authz | _____ | _____ |
| Data exposure | _____ | _____ |
| Injection risks | _____ | _____ |

**🔎 Code Analysis (lenses and impact over the change under review):** Run these two, in order, over the range printed by `diff-range` (everything since the merge base with the upstream branch, plus uncommitted edits and untracked files; the whole history when there is no upstream: then `removed_with_live_callers` cannot find removals, so say the removal check did not run). If `.claude/helpers/kit/cli.js` is missing, say so in one line and continue; the kit is advisory and never blocks a workflow that worked before. Each block starts with a guard for that: with no kit it prints "kit not installed" and ends with status 0, without closing your shell.

1. Lenses: which review rules apply to the changed files.
```bash
if [ ! -f .claude/helpers/kit/cli.js ]; then echo "kit not installed (.claude/helpers/kit/cli.js missing): step skipped, advisory"; (exit 0); else D=$(mktemp 2>/dev/null) && [ -n "$D" ] || { echo "mktemp failed: no temp file for the range" >&2; D=; RC=1; }
if [ -n "$D" ]; then node .claude/helpers/kit/cli.js diff-range > "$D"; RC=$?
case $RC in 0) node .claude/helpers/kit/cli.js lenses --diff "$D"; RC=$?;; 3) echo "no change to review"; RC=0;; *) echo "diff-range failed (exit $RC): the change range was not read" >&2;; esac; fi; [ -z "$D" ] || rm -f "$D"; (exit $RC); fi
```

2. Impact: what depends on the change. The base is resolved once into `B` and given to both `diff-range` and `impact` so they cannot disagree.
```bash
if [ ! -f .claude/helpers/kit/cli.js ]; then echo "kit not installed (.claude/helpers/kit/cli.js missing): step skipped, advisory"; (exit 0); else B=$(node .claude/helpers/kit/cli.js diff-range --base-only); RC=$?
if [ $RC -ne 0 ] || [ -z "$B" ]; then [ $RC -eq 0 ] && RC=1; echo "diff-range --base-only failed (exit $RC): the base was not resolved" >&2; else D=$(mktemp 2>/dev/null) && [ -n "$D" ] || { echo "mktemp failed: no temp file for the range" >&2; D=; RC=1; }
if [ -n "$D" ]; then node .claude/helpers/kit/cli.js diff-range --base "$B" > "$D"; RC=$?
case $RC in 0) node .claude/helpers/kit/cli.js impact --diff "$D" --base "$B"; RC=$?;; 3) echo "no change to review"; RC=0;; *) echo "diff-range failed (exit $RC): the change range was not read" >&2;; esac; fi; [ -z "$D" ] || rm -f "$D"; fi; (exit $RC); fi
```

How to read the results: each entry in `fired` (lenses) has a `name`, the `files` it matched and a `body` to apply as an extra check on those files: add its findings to the review findings above, and mention a non-empty `capped` list. For impact, check every entry of `removed_with_live_callers` (a removal with a caller left behind is a defect until shown otherwise), the `risk` level with its `reasons` and every row of `cuts`; when `risk.lower_bound` is true or `cuts` is not empty the level is a floor, never write "nothing else is affected". Print each symbol's `sentences` as they are; a symbol with `floor: true` and no callers found is not unused.
Exit 3 from `diff-range` means an empty range: report "no change to review", never a failure and never "no lens applies"; the block sets its own status to 0 in that case. Exit 1 is wrong input or a broken state: report it, never skip the step. Exit 2 is a refusal (the repository, a range over 32 MiB, or the verb itself): report it as printed and stop that step, never retry it. Exit 0 from `diff-range` can still leave files out: it writes a note to stderr for an untracked file over the size cap (`too_large`, named) and for untracked files over the count cap (`max_untracked`, a count only); name each skipped file in the findings, say it was not analysed, and treat every result as a floor. If `diff-range` itself fails the step prints "diff-range failed" and the verb does not run; if the temp file cannot be made it prints "mktemp failed": report that the change was not analysed, never "nothing found". Any other non-zero exit (for example 127, or a signal) is a failure of that step: report it, never read it as nothing found.


**USER GATE:** Use AskUserQuestion
- Question: "Security review complete. Proceed to Compound?"
- Options: ["Continue", "Address security concerns", "Show more detail"]

STOP and wait for user response.

### 🔒 CLOSING STEP: Scrub and receipt
After Verification passes and before Compound, first run `git add` on the new files the work created: `scrub --worktree` scans tracked files only and the receipt is keyed on the base and the tracked tree, so untracked files are in neither until they are added. Then scan the tracked files as they are on disk for secrets, and record the review verdict. If `.claude/helpers/kit/cli.js` is missing, say so in one line and continue; the kit is advisory and never blocks a workflow that worked before.
```bash
if [ ! -f .claude/helpers/kit/cli.js ]; then echo "kit not installed (.claude/helpers/kit/cli.js missing): scrub skipped, advisory"; (exit 0); else node .claude/helpers/kit/cli.js scrub --worktree; RC=$?; (exit $RC); fi
```
Exit 0 is clean for the tracked files (or no pattern file is configured: then nothing was scanned, say so); a file still untracked was not scanned. Exit 2 means hits or an incomplete scan: list them as printed and stop, do not commit. Exit 1 is wrong input or a broken state: report it, never read it as clean. Any other non-zero exit is a failure of the step: report it.

Then record the counts from the review findings, with the real finding counts in place of the numbers (add `--incomplete` if any category was skipped). With no kit, skip this too and say so ("kit not installed (.claude/helpers/kit/cli.js missing): receipt skipped, advisory"). Use the form that matches the verdict:
```
node .claude/helpers/kit/cli.js push-gate receipt --verdict pass --high 0 --medium 0 --low 0
node .claude/helpers/kit/cli.js push-gate receipt --verdict fail --high 1 --medium 2 --low 0
```
Exit 0 means the receipt was written; exit 1 is wrong input or a broken state and exit 2 a refused receipt store: report either as printed, never read a failed receipt as recorded. Compound may change tracked files: after Compound, `git add` its new files and, if the tracked tree changed, record the receipt again so it matches what is committed. Then tell the user: run `node .claude/helpers/kit/cli.js push-gate check` before pushing (same `--base`, or none, used for the receipt). Its exit 0 means abstain or ask (read `decision`), exit 2 deny (read `decision` and `reason`) or a refused receipt store (`kit: refused:` on stderr), and exit 1 an error; none is an allow. It only abstains, asks or denies; it never skips their permission prompt.

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 4: Compound (MANDATORY - NEVER SKIP)
**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Memory key: project/incidents/_____
- Doc path: docs/solutions/incidents/_____.md
- Incident documented: yes/no

**RALPH CANDIDATE CHECK (MANDATORY):**
- Dev pattern identified for future Ralph loop: yes/no
- If yes, logged to: .claude/ralph-candidates.md (use format: RC-NNN)

**AUTORESEARCH CANDIDATE CHECK (RC-A):**
Scan the work just completed for measurable optimization targets:
1. **Static scan:** Analyze git diff for measurable patterns (function runtimes, test duration, bundle size, query counts, memory usage, coverage gaps)
2. **Agent reflection:** What about this work could be measured and autonomously optimized?
3. **Impact scoring:** Rate each candidate on 4 dimensions (weighted composite):
   - potential (0.35): estimated improvement magnitude (1-10)
   - blast_radius (0.15): files/systems affected, inverted (1-10)
   - risk (0.15): breaking change likelihood, inverted (1-10)
   - value (0.35): user/business value of improvement (1-10)
   - Composite = (potential * 0.35) + ((10 - blast_radius) * 0.15) + ((10 - risk) * 0.15) + (value * 0.35)
4. If candidates found, append RC-A entries to .claude/ralph-candidates.md:
```
## RC-A[NNN]: [Title]
**KPI:** [metric_name]
**Baseline:** [current value]
**Benchmark:** `[command to measure]`
**Impact Score:** [composite] (potential: N, blast_radius: N, risk: N, value: N)
**Files in scope:** [paths]
**Constraints:** [what must not break]
```
- RC-A candidates found: yes/no
- If yes, logged with impact scores to .claude/ralph-candidates.md


NEVER skip this phase. Workflow is INCOMPLETE without compound.
