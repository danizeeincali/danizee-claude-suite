# /w-hotfix

Critical Hotfix - Isolated branch → minimal fix → security-focused review → expedited PR.

## Usage
```
/w-hotfix [issue description]
```

---

## ⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST ACTION

Use TodoWrite NOW to create todos for ALL phases:
1. Search for similar incidents
2. Create isolated hotfix branch
3. Apply minimal targeted fix
4. Run security review
5. Compound incident documentation

⚠️ VIOLATION: Any action before TodoWrite = restart workflow

---

## Rules

- NEVER skip checkpoints - each requires user confirmation
- NEVER skip security review - hotfixes MUST be security-reviewed
- NEVER skip compound phase at the end
- VIOLATION: Applying fix without isolated branch = restart workflow

---

## Execution Protocol

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 0: Search

**🌐 BROWSER CHECK (conditional):**
If this task involves UI, frontend, or visual changes:
1. Use agent-browser to screenshot the current state before changes
2. `agent-browser open <url>` → `agent-browser screenshot`
3. Note current UI state for comparison after build

If agent-browser is not available, prompt: `npx playwright install`
Skip this block for non-UI tasks.

**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- List of similar incidents (0+ items with memory keys)
- Relevance assessment for each

**USER GATE:** Use AskUserQuestion
- Question: "Found [N] similar incidents. Proceed to create hotfix branch?"
- Options: ["Proceed to Isolate", "Review existing incidents", "Show more detail"]

STOP and wait for user response.

---

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 1: Branch Created
**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Hotfix branch name: hotfix/_____
- Base branch: _____
- Branch creation confirmed: yes/no

**USER GATE:** Use AskUserQuestion
- Question: "Hotfix branch created: [branch]. Proceed to apply fix?"
- Options: ["Continue", "Revise branch", "Show more detail"]

STOP and wait for user response.

---

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 2: Fix Applied

**🌐 BROWSER CHECK (conditional):**
If this task involves UI, frontend, or visual changes:
1. Use agent-browser to verify the implementation visually
2. `agent-browser open <url>` → `agent-browser snapshot -i` → verify elements
3. Compare against pre-change screenshots from Search phase

If agent-browser is not available, prompt: `npx playwright install`
Skip this block for non-UI tasks.

**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Files modified: _____
- Changes summary (minimal): _____
- Test results: _____

**AUTO-PROCEED:** Continue to Security Review phase.

---

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 3: Security Review (MANDATORY - NEVER SKIP)

**🌐 BROWSER CHECK (conditional):**
If this task involves UI, frontend, or visual changes:
1. Final visual verification with agent-browser
2. `agent-browser open <url>` → `agent-browser screenshot` → compare before/after
3. Verify responsive layout, dark mode, accessibility

If agent-browser is not available, prompt: `npx playwright install`
Skip this block for non-UI tasks.

**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Input validation | _____ | _____ |
| Auth/authz | _____ | _____ |
| Data exposure | _____ | _____ |
| Injection risks | _____ | _____ |

**USER GATE:** Use AskUserQuestion
- Question: "Security review complete. Proceed to Compound?"
- Options: ["Continue", "Address security concerns", "Show more detail"]

STOP and wait for user response.

### ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKPOINT — Cross-Method Validation
**Independent verification of deliverables. Do NOT trust self-reported results.**

**Verification Checks:**
1. **Files Exist** — Verify all claimed implementation file paths actually exist on disk
2. **Tests Re-run** — Independent re-run of ALL tests (not trusting earlier output)
3. **Git Diff Matches Plan** — Compare `git diff --stat` against planned files-to-modify list
4. **Build Compiles** — Run build command if applicable, verify zero errors
5. **No Regressions** — Run full test suite to catch regressions beyond new tests

**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Files verified: _____ / _____ exist
- Tests re-run: _____ pass / _____ total
- Git diff matches plan: yes/no
- Build status: pass/fail/n-a
- Regressions: none / [list]

**RETRY LOGIC (max 3 retries):**
- PASS → proceed to next phase
- FAIL + retries remaining → log failure reason, fix the issue, re-verify
- FAIL + max retries exceeded → escalate to user with AskUserQuestion

---

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 4: Compound (MANDATORY - NEVER SKIP)
**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Memory key: project/incidents/_____
- Doc path: docs/solutions/incidents/_____.md
- Incident documented: yes/no

**RALPH CANDIDATE CHECK (MANDATORY):**
- Dev pattern identified for future Ralph loop: yes/no
- If yes, logged to: .claude/ralph-candidates.md (use format: RC-NNN)

NEVER skip this phase. Workflow is INCOMPLETE without compound.
