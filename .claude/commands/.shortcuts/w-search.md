## Model Policy (fable/sonnet)

Route EVERY subagent this workflow spawns by work type — never let a spawn silently inherit the session model:

- **Thinking** (planning, architecture, root-cause analysis, adversarial review/verification, final judgment): `model: fable` (claude-fable-5).
- **Execution** (everything else — scoped builds, discovery sweeps, doc/compound writing, mechanical work): `model: sonnet` (Sonnet 5).
- **Opus fallback:** if fable is unavailable (access removed, usage exhausted, or the model errors), fall back to `model: opus` (claude-opus-4-8) for that step.
- **Escalation on detectable failure:** sonnet → fable (substitute opus when fable is unavailable). Never retry the same tier twice.
