# /w-bg-perf

Background Performance Audit - Full auto-proceed profiling with no user gates.

**Philosophy:** Profile, analyze, document - all autonomous. Complete coverage, no gates.

## Usage
```
/w-bg-perf [target description]
```

---

## ⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST ACTION

Use TodoWrite NOW to create todos for ALL phases:
1. Search for past performance optimizations
2. Profile and identify bottlenecks
3. Analyze and prioritize recommendations
4. Compound performance patterns
5. Git commit

⚠️ VIOLATION: Any action before TodoWrite = restart workflow

---

## Rules

- All checkpoints auto-proceed - NO user gates
- NEVER skip any performance category
- NEVER skip compound phase at the end
- NEVER skip git commit phase at the end
- VIOLATION: Incomplete profiling = incomplete audit

---

## Checks Performed
- N+1 query detection
- Memory leak analysis
- CPU bottlenecks
- I/O optimization
- Caching opportunities
- Bundle size analysis

---

## Execution Protocol

### Phase 0: Search

**🌐 BROWSER CHECK (conditional):**
If this task involves UI, frontend, or visual changes:
1. Use agent-browser to screenshot the current state before changes
2. `agent-browser open <url>` → `agent-browser screenshot`
3. Note current UI state for comparison after build

If agent-browser is not available, prompt: `npx playwright install`
Skip this block for non-UI tasks.

**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- List of past optimizations (0+ items with memory keys)
- Relevance assessment for each

**AUTO-PROCEED:** Continue to Profiling phase.

---

### Phase 1: Profiling Done

**🌐 BROWSER CHECK (conditional):**
If this task involves UI, frontend, or visual changes:
1. Use agent-browser to verify the implementation visually
2. `agent-browser open <url>` → `agent-browser snapshot -i` → verify elements
3. Compare against pre-change screenshots from Search phase

If agent-browser is not available, prompt: `npx playwright install`
Skip this block for non-UI tasks.

**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
| Category | Finding | Impact | Location |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|
| N+1 queries | _____ | _____ | _____ |
| Memory | _____ | _____ | _____ |
| CPU | _____ | _____ | _____ |
| I/O | _____ | _____ | _____ |
| Caching | _____ | _____ | _____ |
| Bundle size | _____ | _____ | _____ |

**AUTO-PROCEED:** Continue to Analysis phase.

---

### Phase 2: Analysis Complete

**🌐 BROWSER CHECK (conditional):**
If this task involves UI, frontend, or visual changes:
1. Final visual verification with agent-browser
2. `agent-browser open <url>` → `agent-browser screenshot` → compare before/after
3. Verify responsive layout, dark mode, accessibility

If agent-browser is not available, prompt: `npx playwright install`
Skip this block for non-UI tasks.

**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Prioritized recommendations (by impact)
- Estimated improvement metrics
- Implementation suggestions

**AUTO-PROCEED:** Continue to Verification phase.

---

### ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKPOINT — Cross-Method Validation
**Independent verification of deliverables. Do NOT trust self-reported results.**

**Verification Checks:**
1. **Files Exist** — Verify all claimed implementation file paths actually exist on disk
2. **Tests Re-run** — Independent re-run of ALL tests (not trusting earlier output)
3. **Git Diff Matches Plan** — Compare `git diff --stat` against planned files-to-modify list
4. **Build Compiles** — Run build command if applicable, verify zero errors
5. **No Regressions** — Run full test suite to catch regressions beyond new tests

**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Files verified: _____ / _____ exist
- Tests re-run: _____ pass / _____ total
- Git diff matches plan: yes/no
- Build status: pass/fail/n-a
- Regressions: none / [list]

**RETRY LOGIC (max 3 retries):**
- PASS → proceed to next phase
- FAIL + retries remaining → log failure reason, fix the issue, re-verify
- FAIL + max retries exceeded → log error and mark workflow as FAILED

---

### Phase 3: Compound (MANDATORY - NEVER SKIP)
**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Memory key: project/performance/_____
- Doc path: docs/solutions/performance/_____.md
- All findings documented: yes/no

**RALPH CANDIDATE CHECK (MANDATORY):**
- Dev pattern identified for future Ralph loop: yes/no
- If yes, logged to: .claude/ralph-candidates.md (use format: RC-NNN)

NEVER skip this phase. Workflow is INCOMPLETE without compound.

**AUTO-PROCEED:** Continue to Git Commit phase.

---

### Phase 4: Git Commit (MANDATORY - NEVER SKIP)
**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Commit hash: _____
- Files committed: _____
- Branch: _____

Commit all changes with a descriptive message including:
- Performance audit summary
- Workflow: /w-bg-perf
- Co-author attribution

NEVER skip this phase. Workflow is INCOMPLETE without commit.
