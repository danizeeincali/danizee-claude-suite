# /w-end

Gracefully end a session by compounding knowledge and committing work.

## Usage
```
/w-end
/w-end [category]
```

Categories: feature, bug, security, performance, architecture, debug

## Model Policy (fable/sonnet)

Route EVERY subagent this workflow spawns by work type — never let a spawn silently inherit the session model:

- **Thinking** (planning, architecture, root-cause analysis, adversarial review/verification, final judgment): `model: fable` (claude-fable-5).
- **Execution** (everything else — scoped builds, discovery sweeps, doc/compound writing, mechanical work): `model: sonnet` (Sonnet 5).
- **Opus fallback:** if fable is unavailable (access removed, usage exhausted, or the model errors), fall back to `model: opus` (claude-opus-4-8) for that step.
- **Escalation on detectable failure:** sonnet → fable (substitute opus when fable is unavailable). Never retry the same tier twice.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY EXECUTION

This command MUST complete all steps. NEVER skip compound or commit.

---

## Execution Protocol

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 0: Summary
**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Work accomplished: _____
- Files modified: _____
- Tests added/changed: _____
- Key decisions: _____

**USER GATE:** Use AskUserQuestion
- Question: "Session summary ready. Proceed to Compound?"
- Options: ["Continue", "Add more details"]

STOP and wait for user response.

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 1: Compound (MANDATORY - NEVER SKIP)
**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Memory key: project/[category]/_____
- Doc path: docs/solutions/[category]/_____.md
- Patterns captured: _____

**RALPH CANDIDATE CHECK (MANDATORY):**
- Dev pattern identified for future Ralph loop: yes/no
- If yes, logged to: .claude/ralph-candidates.md (use format: RC-NNN)

**AUTORESEARCH CANDIDATE CHECK (RC-A):**
Scan the work just completed for measurable optimization targets:
1. **Static scan:** Analyze git diff for measurable patterns (function runtimes, test duration, bundle size, query counts, memory usage, coverage gaps)
2. **Agent reflection:** What about this work could be measured and autonomously optimized?
3. **Impact scoring:** Rate each candidate on 4 dimensions (weighted composite):
   - potential (0.35): estimated improvement magnitude (1-10)
   - blast_radius (0.15): files/systems affected, inverted (1-10)
   - risk (0.15): breaking change likelihood, inverted (1-10)
   - value (0.35): user/business value of improvement (1-10)
   - Composite = (potential * 0.35) + ((10 - blast_radius) * 0.15) + ((10 - risk) * 0.15) + (value * 0.35)
4. If candidates found, append RC-A entries to .claude/ralph-candidates.md:
```
## RC-A[NNN]: [Title]
**KPI:** [metric_name]
**Baseline:** [current value]
**Benchmark:** `[command to measure]`
**Impact Score:** [composite] (potential: N, blast_radius: N, risk: N, value: N)
**Files in scope:** [paths]
**Constraints:** [what must not break]
```
- RC-A candidates found: yes/no
- If yes, logged with impact scores to .claude/ralph-candidates.md


---

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 2: Commit (MANDATORY - NEVER SKIP)
**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Commit message: _____
- Files staged: _____
- Commit hash: _____

**USER GATE:** Use AskUserQuestion
- Question: "Commit complete. Session ended. Run /w-start to resume later."
- Options: ["Done", "Push to remote"]

STOP and wait for user response.

/w-end
/w-end feature
/w-end bug
```

## Next Session
Run `/w-start` to load this session's context and continue where you left off.
