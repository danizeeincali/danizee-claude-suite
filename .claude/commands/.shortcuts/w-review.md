## ⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST ACTION

Use TodoWrite NOW to create todos for ALL phases:
1. Search for past review patterns
2. Run code analysis
3. Run security scan
4. Run performance check
5. Run architecture review
6. Compound review findings

⚠️ VIOLATION: Any action before TodoWrite = restart workflow

---

## Rules

- NEVER skip checkpoints - each requires user confirmation
- NEVER skip any review category
- NEVER skip compound phase at the end
- VIOLATION: Completing review without all categories = incomplete

## Execution Protocol

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 0: Search

**🌐 BROWSER CHECK (conditional):**
If this task involves UI, frontend, or visual changes:
1. Use agent-browser to screenshot the current state before changes
2. `agent-browser open <url>` → `agent-browser screenshot`
3. Note current UI state for comparison after build

If agent-browser is not available, prompt: `npx playwright install`
Skip this block for non-UI tasks.

**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- List of past reviews (0+ items with memory keys)
- Relevance assessment for each

**USER GATE:** Use AskUserQuestion
- Question: "Found [N] past reviews for this area. Proceed to Code Analysis?"
- Options: ["Continue", "Review past findings first", "Show more detail"]

STOP and wait for user response.

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 1: Code Analysis

**🌐 BROWSER CHECK (conditional):**
If this task involves UI, frontend, or visual changes:
1. Use agent-browser to verify the implementation visually
2. `agent-browser open <url>` → `agent-browser snapshot -i` → verify elements
3. Compare against pre-change screenshots from Search phase

If agent-browser is not available, prompt: `npx playwright install`
Skip this block for non-UI tasks.

**🔎 LENS CHECKS (file-triggered review rules):**
Review rules live as markdown files (built in, plus any in `.claude/kit/lenses/`). Write the change under review to a temp file and ask which rules apply:
The range is the same one the push check uses: everything since the merge base with the upstream branch (the whole history when there is no upstream), plus uncommitted edits and untracked files. `--no-prefix` keeps paths bare whatever `diff.mnemonicPrefix` says.
```bash
BASE=$(git merge-base HEAD '@{upstream}' 2>/dev/null || git hash-object -t tree /dev/null)
D=$(mktemp)
{ git diff --no-color --no-ext-diff --no-prefix "$BASE"; git ls-files -z --others --exclude-standard | while IFS= read -r -d '' f; do git diff --no-color --no-ext-diff --no-index --no-prefix /dev/null "$f"; done; true; } > "$D"
node .claude/helpers/kit/cli.js lenses --diff "$D"; rm -f "$D"
```
If the review was started with a base (`push-gate receipt --base <ref>`), use that ref in place of the first line's merge-base so both cover the same change. An empty or non-diff file makes the verb exit 1 ("no diff was given"): that is wrong input, so fix the range; never record it as "no lens applies".
Each entry in `fired` has a `name`, the `files` it matched and a `body`: apply the body as an extra check on those files and add its findings to the table below. A non-empty `capped` list means more lenses applied than the cap (4); mention them in the table. If a deterministic check already ran for the same rule, say so with `--covered` (for example `--covered no-floating-promises`) and that lens stands down. A non-zero exit means a lens file is broken: report it, do not skip the step.

**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
| Category | Finding | Severity |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Style | _____ | _____ |
| Patterns | _____ | _____ |
| Quality | _____ | _____ |
| Simplicity | _____ | _____ |

**AUTO-PROCEED:** Continue to Security Scan phase.

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 2: Security Scan
**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
| Vulnerability | Risk | Location |
|---------------|------|----------|
| _____ | _____ | _____ |

**AUTO-PROCEED:** Continue to Performance Check phase.

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 3: Performance Check
**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
| Opportunity | Impact | Location |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| _____ | _____ | _____ |

**AUTO-PROCEED:** Continue to Ralph Candidates phase.

---

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 4: Ralph Candidates (AUTO-PROCEED)
**Scan for dev patterns that could become future Ralph loops:**
- Repeating code patterns in this PR
- Bug fix patterns that recur
- Feature patterns worth templating

**If candidate identified:**
1. Generate unique ID: RC-NNN (check .claude/ralph-candidates.md for next available)
2. Assign priority: P1 (critical) / P2 (important) / P3 (nice-to-have)
3. Define AI-verifiable completion tests:
   - File exists: `path/to/expected/file`
   - Pattern match: `"regex"` in `file`
   - Test passes: `npm test -- --grep "name"`
   - Lint clean: `npm run lint`
4. Add entry to .claude/ralph-candidates.md
5. Set initial status: draft

**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Candidates identified: 0/1/2+
- If any:
  - ID(s) added: RC-___
  - Priority: P_
  - Completion tests defined: yes/no

**AUTO-PROCEED:** Continue to Verification phase.

### ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKPOINT — Cross-Method Validation
**Independent verification of deliverables. Do NOT trust self-reported results.**

**Verification Checks:**
1. **Files Exist** — Verify all claimed implementation file paths actually exist on disk
2. **Tests Re-run** — Independent re-run of ALL tests (not trusting earlier output)
3. **Git Diff Matches Plan** — Compare `git diff --stat` against planned files-to-modify list
4. **Build Compiles** — Run build command if applicable, verify zero errors
5. **No Regressions** — Run full test suite to catch regressions beyond new tests

**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Files verified: _____ / _____ exist
- Tests re-run: _____ pass / _____ total
- Git diff matches plan: yes/no
- Build status: pass/fail/n-a
- Regressions: none / [list]

**RETRY LOGIC (max 3 retries):**
- PASS → proceed to next phase
- FAIL + retries remaining → log failure reason, fix the issue, re-verify
- FAIL + max retries exceeded → escalate to user with AskUserQuestion

---

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 5: Compound (MANDATORY - NEVER SKIP)
**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Memory key: project/reviews/_____
- Doc path: docs/solutions/reviews/_____.md
- All findings documented: yes/no

**RALPH CANDIDATE CHECK (MANDATORY):**
- Dev pattern identified for future Ralph loop: yes/no
- If yes, logged to: .claude/ralph-candidates.md (use format: RC-NNN)

**AUTORESEARCH CANDIDATE CHECK (RC-A):**
Scan the work just completed for measurable optimization targets:
1. **Static scan:** Analyze git diff for measurable patterns (function runtimes, test duration, bundle size, query counts, memory usage, coverage gaps)
2. **Agent reflection:** What about this work could be measured and autonomously optimized?
3. **Impact scoring:** Rate each candidate on 4 dimensions (weighted composite):
   - potential (0.35): estimated improvement magnitude (1-10)
   - blast_radius (0.15): files/systems affected, inverted (1-10)
   - risk (0.15): breaking change likelihood, inverted (1-10)
   - value (0.35): user/business value of improvement (1-10)
   - Composite = (potential * 0.35) + ((10 - blast_radius) * 0.15) + ((10 - risk) * 0.15) + (value * 0.35)
4. If candidates found, append RC-A entries to .claude/ralph-candidates.md:
```
## RC-A[NNN]: [Title]
**KPI:** [metric_name]
**Baseline:** [current value]
**Benchmark:** `[command to measure]`
**Impact Score:** [composite] (potential: N, blast_radius: N, risk: N, value: N)
**Files in scope:** [paths]
**Constraints:** [what must not break]
```
- RC-A candidates found: yes/no
- If yes, logged with impact scores to .claude/ralph-candidates.md


NEVER skip this phase. Workflow is INCOMPLETE without compound.

- [ ] TodoWrite used at start with all 6 phases
- [ ] Checkpoint 0 completed with user confirmation
- [ ] Checkpoints 1-5 completed (auto-proceed)
- [ ] Code analysis completed
- [ ] Security scan completed

⚠️ Workflow INCOMPLETE until all boxes checked

## Closing step: record the push receipt
Record the review's counts so the advisory push gate can recognise this exact change. Use the form that matches the verdict, with the real finding counts in place of the numbers (add `--incomplete` if any category was skipped, and `--threshold high`, `--threshold medium` or `--threshold low` if the user wants the push check to deny at that level):
```
node .claude/helpers/kit/cli.js push-gate receipt --verdict pass --high 0 --medium 0 --low 0
node .claude/helpers/kit/cli.js push-gate receipt --verdict fail --high 1 --medium 2 --low 0
```
Then tell the user: run `node .claude/helpers/kit/cli.js push-gate check` before pushing, with the same `--threshold` level and the same `--base` (or none) used for the receipt. It only abstains, asks or denies; it never skips their permission prompt. Reviewing uncommitted edits and then committing them unchanged still matches.
