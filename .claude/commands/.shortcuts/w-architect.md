# /w-architect

Hive-Mind Architecture - Multiple agents collaborate with collective intelligence for complex design.

## Usage
```
/w-architect [system description]
```

---

## ⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST ACTION

Use TodoWrite NOW to create todos for ALL phases:
1. Search for related architecture decisions
2. Initialize hive-mind collaboration
3. Generate design proposals
4. Reach consensus on design
5. Compound architecture decision record

⚠️ VIOLATION: Any action before TodoWrite = restart workflow

---

## Rules

- NEVER skip checkpoints - each requires user confirmation
- NEVER skip consensus phase - all options must be evaluated
- NEVER skip compound phase at the end
- VIOLATION: Skipping proposals = incomplete architecture

---

## Execution Protocol

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 0: Search
**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- List of related ADRs (0+ items with memory keys)
- Relevance assessment for each

**USER GATE:** Use AskUserQuestion
- Question: "Found [N] related architecture decisions. Proceed to Hive Init?"
- Options: ["Continue", "Review past decisions first", "Show more detail"]

STOP and wait for user response.

---

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 1: Hive Initialized
**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Agent assignments:
| Agent | Role | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| _____ | system-architect | _____ |
| _____ | analyst | _____ |
| _____ | domain-expert | _____ |

- Hive topology: _____

**USER GATE:** Use AskUserQuestion
- Question: "Hive initialized with [N] agents. Proceed to Design Proposals?"
- Options: ["Continue", "Revise agents", "Show more detail"]

STOP and wait for user response.

---

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 2: Design Proposals
**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| Option A | _____ | _____ | _____ |
| Option B | _____ | _____ | _____ |
| Option C | _____ | _____ | _____ |

**USER GATE:** Use AskUserQuestion
- Question: "[N] design options generated. Proceed to Consensus?"
- Options: ["Continue", "Explore more options", "Show more detail"]

STOP and wait for user response.

---

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 3: Consensus Reached
**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Recommended design: _____
- Rationale: _____
- Trade-offs accepted: _____
- Implementation roadmap: _____

**USER GATE:** Use AskUserQuestion
- Question: "Consensus: [Option X]. Proceed to Compound?"
- Options: ["Continue", "Revisit options", "Show more detail"]

STOP and wait for user response.

---

### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 4: Compound (MANDATORY - NEVER SKIP)
**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Memory key: project/architecture/_____
- Doc path: docs/solutions/architecture/_____-adr.md
- ADR documented: yes/no

**RALPH CANDIDATE CHECK (MANDATORY):**
- Dev pattern identified for future Ralph loop: yes/no
- If yes, logged to: .claude/ralph-candidates.md (use format: RC-NNN)

NEVER skip this phase. Workflow is INCOMPLETE without compound.

## Completion Checklist

Before marking workflow complete, verify ALL boxes:
- [ ] TodoWrite used at start with all 5 phases
- [ ] All 5 checkpoints completed with user confirmation
- [ ] Multiple design options evaluated
- [ ] Consensus reached with rationale
- [ ] Compound phase executed
- [ ] Memory key stored: _____
- [ ] ADR doc created: _____
- [ ] Ralph candidate check completed

⚠️ Workflow INCOMPLETE until all boxes checked

## Compounds
```
Memory: project/architecture/[system-name]
Doc: docs/solutions/architecture/[system-name]-adr.md
```

## Example
```
